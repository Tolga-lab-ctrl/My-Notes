Today my goal is to hack the machine called "TwoMillion" from HackTheBox.
First i started scanning with nmap 

nmap -sV 10.10.11.221

The port 80 was open so i checked the webpage but i coudnt access it so i ran this command.

sudo nano /etc/hosts

And added the ip address
then i ran a directory enumeration tool called gobuster and saw intersting directory called /invite
The question was: What is the name of the JavaScript file loaded by the /invite page that has to do with invite codes?
So i inspected the webpage in the network tab and saw inviteapi.min.js.

Then i visited http://2million.htb/js/inviteapi.min.js to check the java script code and it was obfuscated so i used chatgpt to get more info.
The code was:
function verifyInviteCode(code) {
    var formData = { "code": code };
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        dataType: "json",
        data: formData,
        url: '/api/v1/invite/verify',
        success: function(response) {
            console.log(response);
        },
        error: function(response) {
            console.log(response);
        }
    });
}

function makeInviteCode() {
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        dataType: "json",
        url: '/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate',
        success: function(response) {
            console.log(response);
        },
        error: function(response) {
            console.log(response);
        }
    });
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

Then i saw a url to generate a invite code. I used curl to generate the code then i decrypted the base64 invite code with cyberchef.io. With the info i gathered i created my account in the webpage so i can have more control.
So i went to get a vpn file and used f12 inspect menu to see what path does it use to generete the vpn file.

Next Question was: How many API endpoints are there under /api/v1/admin?

so to check it i ran the command:
curl -X GET "http://2million.htb/api/v1" -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=6uc53k8s81u22kaugovo0k087t" | jq

Output:

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

{
  "v1": {
    "user": {
      "GET": {
        "/api/v1": "Route List",
        "/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate": "Instructions on invite code generation",
        "/api/v1/invite/generate": "Generate invite code",
        "/api/v1/invite/verify": "Verify invite code",
        "/api/v1/user/auth": "Check if user is authenticated",
        "/api/v1/user/vpn/generate": "Generate a new VPN configuration",
        "/api/v1/user/vpn/regenerate": "Regenerate VPN configuration",
        "/api/v1/user/vpn/download": "Download OVPN file"
      },
      "POST": {
        "/api/v1/user/register": "Register a new user",
        "/api/v1/user/login": "Login with existing user"
      }
    },
    "admin": {
      "GET": {
        "/api/v1/admin/auth": "Check if user is admin"
      },
      "POST": {
        "/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate": "Generate VPN for specific user"
      },
      "PUT": {
        "/api/v1/admin/settings/update": "Update user settings"
      }
    }
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                         
There was 3 endpoints under the /api/v1/admin and the interesting one was Update user settings witch potentionaly can give us a admin privilages.
so i first tryed by making a new account and using the intercepter than added &is_admin:1 but it didnt work :)
So i tryed using the enpoint /api/v1/settings/update and the repeater in burpsuit.
First i changed the content-type to application/json then added parameters
{
	"email":"Tester@htb.com",
	"is_admin":1
}
And when i sended it i was admin.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next Question:
 What API endpoint has a command injection vulnerability in it?

/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate

From this point i started messing with the vpn file.
Its observed that generated VPN profile endpoint is vulnerable to command Injection. 
Basically typing something in the username parameter and adding ;<command>; using the method i can run ls and other commands.
And used netcat and runned the reverse shell command with the method on the system.
& got ReverseShell.
And ofcourse upgrade the shell to be fully functional.
i used the command cat to .env and saw the admin password than logged in as admin from ssh with the password SuperDuperPass123.
Then i got the user flag.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the hardest part was to get root shell and i had to use CVE-2023-0386.
i looked how does the vulnarability work and how to use it and i did got root acess.
Then got the root flag from the /root directory and finished this ctf too.
